## 🌟 What's New in v1.1.0

### 🎓 Complete CRUD Session Management System

We're excited to introduce a comprehensive session management system that revolutionizes how teachers manage their class sessions!

#### ✨ Key Features

**📋 Full CRUD Operations**
- **Create**: Add new attendance sessions with smart validation
- **Read**: View sessions with advanced filtering and search
- **Update**: Edit session details (except class assignment)
- **Delete**: Remove sessions (only if no attendance records exist)

**🔍 Advanced Filtering & Search**
- Filter by class, date range, and search terms
- Real-time search across session titles, descriptions, and locations
- Smart date filtering with "From" and "To" date pickers
- Class-specific filtering for focused management

**⚡ Intelligent Validation System**
- **Time Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping sessions for the same teacher
- **Classroom Booking**: Ensures no double-booking of the same location
- **Student Schedule Conflicts**: Detects conflicts when students are enrolled in multiple classes
- **Past Date Prevention**: Cannot schedule sessions in the past
- **Business Logic**: End time must be after start time

#### 🎨 Modern UI/UX Design

- Tooltips for better accessibility

#### 📊 Enhanced Data Display
